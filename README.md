- **LWHandwrittingViewController**: Handwriting input and path tracking

### Basic Usage

#### 1. Chinese Brush Calligraphy Board

The `AFBrushBoard` component provides realistic Chinese brush calligraphy effects:

```objective-c
#import <LWDrawboard/AFBrushBoard.h>

// Initialize brush board
AFBrushBoard *brushBoard = [[AFBrushBoard alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 300, 400)];

// Configure brush properties
brushBoard.penColor = [UIColor blackColor];
brushBoard.penWidth = 10.0; // Default is 13

// Add to view hierarchy
[self.view addSubview:brushBoard];

// Clear all strokes
[brushBoard cleanDrawImage];
```

**Use Cases**: Calligraphy practice apps, signature collection, artistic drawing

#### 2. Handwriting Input View

The `LWHandwrittingView` component enables handwriting capture with path tracking:

```objective-c
#import <LWDrawboard/LWHandwrittingView.h>

// Create handwriting input view
LWHandwrittingView *handwritingView = [LWHandwrittingView handwrittingViewWithFrame:self.view.bounds
                                                                             delegate:self];

// Configure appearance
handwritingView.lineColor = [UIColor blueColor];
handwritingView.lineWidth = 2.0;

// Add to view hierarchy
[self.view addSubview:handwritingView];
```

**Implement the delegate protocol** to receive touch events:

```objective-c
#pragma mark - LWHandwrittingViewProtocol

- (void)touchMovedWithPoint:(CGPoint)touchPoint pathPoints:(NSMutableArray *)pathPoints {
    // Track drawing progress
    NSLog(@"Touch moved at: %@", NSStringFromCGPoint(touchPoint));
}

- (void)touchMoveEndWithPoint:(CGPoint)touchPoint pathPoints:(NSMutableArray *)pathPoints {
    // Handle stroke completion
    NSLog(@"Touch ended at: %@", NSStringFromCGPoint(touchPoint));
    // Process pathPoints for handwriting recognition
}

- (void)touchCancelledWithPathPoints:(NSMutableArray *)pathPoints {
    // Handle cancelled input
    NSLog(@"Touch cancelled");
}
```

**Use Cases**: Handwriting recognition, signature capture, gesture detection

#### 3. Full-Featured Drawing Canvas

The `LWDrawView` is the main component providing complete drawing functionality:

```objective-c
#import <LWDrawboard/LWDrawView.h>
#import <LWDrawboard/LWDrawBar.h>

// Initialize drawing view with delegate
LWDrawView *drawView = [LWDrawView drawViewWithDelegate:self];
drawView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, self.view.bounds.size.width, self.view.bounds.size.height - 60);

// Configure background
drawView.backgroundFillColor = [UIColor whiteColor];

// Set initial drawing tool
drawView.drawType = Hand; // Free brush mode

// Configure brush properties
drawView.freeInkColor = [UIColor blackColor];
drawView.freeInkLinewidth = 3.0;

// Enable advanced features
drawView.openShadow = YES;    // Enable shadow effects
drawView.enableEdit = YES;    // Allow editing existing elements

// Add to view hierarchy
[self.view addSubview:drawView];

// Create and configure toolbar
CGFloat toolbarHeight = 60;
LWDrawBar *drawBar = [LWDrawBar drawBarWithFrame:CGRectMake(0,
                                                              self.view.bounds.size.height - toolbarHeight,
                                                              self.view.bounds.size.width,
                                                              toolbarHeight)];
[self.view addSubview:drawBar];
```

**Use Cases**: Image annotation, photo editing, whiteboard apps, note-taking

### Advanced Features

#### Switching Drawing Tools

LWDrawboard supports dynamic tool switching at runtime:

```objective-c
// Eraser mode
drawView.drawType = Erase;

// Geometric shapes
drawView.drawType = Rectangle;      // Outline rectangle
drawView.drawType = RectangleFill;  // Filled rectangle
drawView.drawType = RectangleDash;  // Dashed rectangle
drawView.drawType = Oval;           // Outline circle/oval
drawView.drawType = OvalFill;       // Filled circle/oval
drawView.drawType = OvalDash;       // Dashed circle/oval

// Lines and arrows
drawView.drawType = Line;           // Straight line
drawView.drawType = LineDash;       // Dashed line
drawView.drawType = LineArrow;      // Arrow

// Text annotation
drawView.drawType = Text;

// Chinese brush calligraphy
drawView.drawType = ChinesePen;
drawView.chinesePenWidth = 13.0;
```

#### Managing Drawing State

```objective-c
// Clear all content and reset the canvas
[drawView resetDrawing];

// Exit editing or text input mode
[drawView exitEditingOrTexting];

// Check current drawing status
if (drawView.drawStatus == Drawing) {
    // Currently drawing
} else if (drawView.drawStatus == Editing) {
    // Currently editing an element
} else if (drawView.drawStatus == Texting) {
    // Currently inputting text
}
```

#### Text and Fonts

```objective-c
// Set custom font for text annotations
drawView.fontName = @"PingFangSC-Regular";

// Available system fonts include:
// - Helvetica, Helvetica-Bold
// - PingFangSC-Regular, PingFangSC-Semibold
// - STFangsong, STHeiti
```

#### Working with Stickers

**Adding Emoji Stickers:**

```objective-c
// Set emoji sticker mode
drawView.drawType = EmojiTile;
drawView.tileEmojiText = @"ðŸ˜€";  // Any emoji character
```

**Adding Image Stickers:**

```objective-c
// Set image sticker mode
drawView.drawType = ImageTile;
drawView.tileAsset = photoAsset; // PHAsset object from photo library
```

**Implement the delegate method** to handle image loading:

```objective-c
#pragma mark - LWDrawViewProtocol

- (void)requestTileImageForAsset:(PHAsset *)tileAsset
                            size:(CGSize)size
                      completion:(void (^)(UIImage *, NSDictionary *))completion {
    // Request image from Photos framework
    PHImageManager *manager = [PHImageManager defaultManager];
    PHImageRequestOptions *options = [[PHImageRequestOptions alloc] init];
    options.synchronous = NO;
    options.deliveryMode = PHImageRequestOptionsDeliveryModeHighQualityFormat;
    options.resizeMode = PHImageRequestOptionsResizeModeExact;

    [manager requestImageForAsset:tileAsset
                       targetSize:size
                      contentMode:PHImageContentModeAspectFit
                          options:options
                    resultHandler:^(UIImage *result, NSDictionary *info) {
        if (completion) {
            completion(result, info);
        }
    }];
}
```

#### Exporting Drawings

```objective-c
// Export the entire canvas as UIImage
UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(drawView.bounds.size, NO, [UIScreen mainScreen].scale);
[drawView.layer renderInContext:UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext()];
UIImage *exportedImage = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();
UIGraphicsEndImageContext();

// Save to photo library
UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum(exportedImage, nil, nil, nil);
```

## FAQ

### How do I save drawings as images?

```objective-c
// Capture the drawing view as UIImage
UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(drawView.bounds.size, NO, 0.0);
CGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();
[drawView.layer renderInContext:context];
UIImage *image = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();
UIGraphicsEndImageContext();

// Save to photo library (requires Photos framework permission)
UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum(image, nil, nil, nil);
```

### Can I customize the color palette?

Yes! LWDrawBar includes 18 preset colors by default. To customize colors, modify the `DrawView_Color_Items` macro definition in the source code, or create your own custom toolbar.

### How do I add custom fonts?

1. Add your font file (`.ttf` or `.otf`) to your Xcode project
2. Add the font filename to your `Info.plist` under `Fonts provided by application`
3. Use the font's PostScript name:

```objective-c
drawView.fontName = @"YourCustomFont-Regular";
```

### How does the Chinese brush effect work?

The Chinese brush calligraphy effect is implemented through `AFBrushBoard`, which:
- Uses Bezier curve interpolation for smooth strokes
- Simulates brush pressure based on touch velocity
- Applies dynamic width variation to mimic real brush behavior
- Renders with anti-aliasing for authentic appearance

### Does LWDrawboard support undo/redo?

Yes! The library includes built-in undo/redo functionality through the curves management system. Each drawing action is recorded as a separate curve object that can be manipulated.

### Can I use LWDrawboard in Swift projects?

Absolutely! LWDrawboard is written in Objective-C but is fully compatible with Swift through the Objective-C bridging mechanism. Simply import the module:

```swift
import LWDrawboard
```

### How do I handle memory management for large canvases?

LWDrawboard is optimized for performance, but for very large canvases or long drawing sessions:
- Use `resetDrawing` periodically to clear the canvas
- Export intermediate results and start fresh
- Consider rendering to a lower resolution for preview purposes
- Monitor memory usage in Instruments
